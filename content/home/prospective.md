I'm looking for students with diverse backgrounds and expertise to work on challenging research problems across the system stack.

- Do you like designing and developing elegant systems that tackle real-world problems?
- Do you have expertise in hardware, software, machine learning, UX, or network protocols and measurement?
- Are you passionate about security and privacy?

If your answer to these questions is yes, there may be a place for you in my group.

Interested? [Fill out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/p9rwEu7Q1FvJeorB3).
