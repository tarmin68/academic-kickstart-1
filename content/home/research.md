# [Ethos Lab](https://github.com/Ethos-lab)
I lead the Ethos lab at Stony Brook University.
In Ethos lab, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Cyber-Physical systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data \& activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design.
