# Research Overview
I'm generally interested in the area of security and privacy. My research focuses on securing emerging technologies. Think about the most recent gadgets or technology that you have heard about, or the cutting-edge research that are happening in other fields. Are there new and unique security and privacy challenges associated with them? How much thought has gone into securing them? My research focuses on identifying and exploring these challenges and developing insights, models, and systems that enable us to secure technologies that will become main-stream in the future.
